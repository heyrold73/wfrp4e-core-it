When not donning the ceremonial gear of his order, Helscher dresses with a lack of vanity, preferring free flowing garments in black or grey which allow him maximum freedom of movement. He is more concerned with abstractions and his research than with ‘real life’, and rarely leaves his apartments and offices in the guildhouse. Consequently, he is little seen by the general populace, who regard him as a mysterious figure to be feared rather than loved.</p>"

Nobody looked that way, so I knew it was what I was after and glided over to it. The great bulk of Alfric was squeezed in there, with one of his henchmen and a fat human in opulent robes sat opposite. The table was covered with empty tankards on the Dwarfs’ side, and gold coins. Alfric looked up. There was more grey in his beard than I remembered, and the scars around his ruined nose were a flaming red: a sure sign he’d been drinking heavily. But it would be unwise for me to assume he’d be drunk, or unobservant.</p><p>‘Good evening, brother,’ he said. ‘Sit down. How may I be of service to the Temple of Morr this evening?’</p><p style=\"text-align: right\"><em>— Hammers of Ulric, by Dan Abnett and James Wallis</em></p></blockquote><blockquote class=\"sidebar\"><p><em>Another character from the Hammers of Ulric novel, Alfric is a blackmailer and information broker, but his services do not come free of cost or risk.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Power Behind the Throne</h3><p>The intrigues and operations of Middenheim’s criminal underworld are of little interest to its Dwarf population. They are honourable traditionalists in the main, and do not care to sully their reputations by getting involved with any sort of criminal activity. Few Dwarfs would sink so low as to work for gangs of organised human criminals, and to be discovered doing so would shame many of them into seeking out honourable death as a Slayer.</p><p>Alfric, though, is among the few exceptions.  A grizzled Dwarf who looks older than his years (and he is by no means a beardling) he has offered his services to the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.Liw9HcyJnHbLZevz]{Low Kings} of Middenheim for longer than a Human generation. By and large Middenheim’s Dwarf community shun Alfric, believing him a disgrace to his family and clan. A small coterie of less honourable Dwarfs, however, do seek him out and provide him with gossip, and the fact that he retains this tenuous link with the Dwarf community makes him a valuable asset as a fence and a trader in sensitive information. </p><p>Much of Alfric’s nose has been cut away. No one is sure why and the episode must have occurred in his youth, as he has been mutilated for as long as anyone in Middenheim can recall. He is a member of the Anvilbreaker family, and pretends a degree of sentiment about his blood relations (just to put people off guard a little, in truth he is too cynical to care). He has a black beard shot through with grey streaks and his dark eyes glint like wet stones. He is not pleasant company, and sets great personal store on his identity as a bitter and insulting individual who belongs nowhere.</p><h3>Middenheim: City of the White Wolf</h3><p>As his name suggests, much of Alfric’s nose has been cut away. No one is sure how he came to be so disfigured, and Alfric isn’t telling. One of the foremost blackmailers and informants in the city, Alfric carefully courts the favour of local @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.Liw9HcyJnHbLZevz]{The Low Kings}, providing free information to the agents of both @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.Liw9HcyJnHbLZevz.JournalEntryPage.hKL3Ash15v1YuorN]{Bleyden, the Lowest King} and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-middenheim.journals.Liw9HcyJnHbLZevz.JournalEntryPage.hPDxL1zqTubGKiVH]{Edam Gouda}.</p><p>If he feels that visiting Characters have interesting stories, he operates on a quid pro quo basis. Otherwise he sells information for between one and ten shillings depending on how juicy he thinks it is. He is able to relay anything known amongst the criminal community.</p><p>Alfric has dealings with another information broker known only as Josef, and he is careful to ensure that neither one of them monopolises the market. Alfric deals in rumours about Middenheim’s underworld whilst Josef specialises in high-society gossip. Alfric can corroborate a story Josef has sold, but only if Josef has been paid for it first. Josef is of no particular abode but Alfric knows how to find him, for a price.</p>"

She takes a pessimistic view of city government and always assumes the worst of intentions in others. She is strongly opposed to the tax, but takes few positive steps towards its repeal as she believes that powerful people will do what they want with few consequences. However, Edel will lend support to the party if they’re working against the taxes, even though she suspects they’ll fail. She is well connected and can provide introductions to several key NPCs.</p><p>Rather than waiting for the party to show an interest in the tax issue, you can use the Cult of Verena as a potential ‘hook’ to involve the Characters in the adventure. An initiate of Verena can accost any Academic, Lawyer, or vaguely bookish Character in the street and thrust a printed pamphlet into their hand. They explain earnestly that the tax is doubly unfair on the @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-core.journals.NcH9OhleJFfaUdon.JournalEntryPage.9bWE0Ayt5XGQf50r]{Cult of Verena}, as it affects the temple and the wizards who tend to congregate there. If they can help the cause, they can potentially have free access to the cult’s extensive library. Any expression of interest gains an audience with Mueller, a sardonic lecture on futility, and her tacit support.</p><p>The most senior priest of Verena in Middenheim, Edel is in her early forties, taller than average with a slim build. She has long black hair that she usually wears in two long plaits. Her eyes are dark brown.</p><p>Edel Mueller’s upbringing was within the Verenan faith and there was never any doubt that she would become a priestess. Both she and her sister left Middenheim to attend @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-altdorf.journals.EmhvOkkzAir6pzCB.JournalEntryPage.OiAVm63T9JEFsVfR]{Altdorf University} before returning to take up posts in the city and @UUID[Compendium.wfrp4e-salzenmund.journals.b2odPrxVAmUf46Sz]{Salzenmund}, where her sister is now High Priestess. The two remain close, but with an undercurrent of rivalry.</p><p>Mueller always looks a little sour or disappointed with the world around her. She can manage a wry smile or sarcastic quip, but charm does not come easy to her, and people tend to assume that she’d rather be hidden in her study reading — which is entirely true. But she is not bitter and there are flashes of humour and friendliness when someone shares her interests or preoccupations.</p><p>Over the years, Mueller’s intelligence has given her a mistrust of power and a fatalism that can run counter to her faith. For many years she was a Scalebearer, the school of thought within the Cult that prioritises justice over learning. But as she became more jaded, she moved towards the Lorekeepers, who believe that salvation comes from knowledge. This personality change has manifested as a compulsion to collect books, particularly rare tomes. Her chambers in the temple are piled high with hundreds of folios, scrolls, and codices, threatening to topple over. She keeps her rarest or forbidden books in a locked antechamber.</p>"

He is 6 feet tall, of medium build, with brown hair, a large moustache, and dark-grey eyes. He attends all court and State ceremonies as his post requires, but is rarely, if ever, seen on other occasions. Siegfried is pompous, affected, and the most crashing bore imaginable. He is also an appalling chauvinist and incredibly patronising (if gallant) to any female he encounters. He has a great love of heraldry, jousting, and military history, and is actually very knowledgeable about such matters. He will lecture anyone about his coat of arms: the device appears on everything he owns (even, it is said, on his underclothes). Woe betide anyone foolish enough to draw him into a conversation on one of his obsessions. </p>"
